about=
    GDAL can't handle raster PMTiles as of yet (last checked 23/10/2025).

    As a consequence QGIS does not have support for reading or writing raster PMTile files.

    This plugin is an interim solution to convert MBTiles file into PMTiles, using the official Python package.

    This plugin uses QPIP for dependency management. The `pmtiles` Python package will be automatically installed when the plugin is loaded.
